There is a repeating theme throughout the views. Each view module has an 'index.js'
and one or more other files, usually with a 'jsx' extension. The 'index.js' file
represents the "container" or connector that connects a React Component with
redux state. Inside each 'index.js' you'll see "s2p", "d2p", "connect", and
sometimes "withRouter".

s2p means "stateToProperties". It basically says, "take data from a redux state
tree and make it a property of a React Component". When you see the React
Components refer to "this.props.X", "X" can be defined as a state property,
a property passed in directly from another component, or as a dispatch operation (d2p).

d2p means "dispatchToProperties". It basically says, "expose certain actions to
the React Component that I can call with the redux dispatch function". This is
what ties the UI components to the Redux operations that ultimately update the
redux state tree. The flow is:

UI -> d2p.opName -> Redux/<module>/operations.opName -> Redux/<module>/actions -> Redux/<module>/reducers

Any interaction from the UI that must update the redux state tree does so using
functions defined in d2p.

The "connect" reference in the index.js is what "connects" or binds the state
and dispatch properties to the React Component instance.

The "withRouter" reference is used in cases where navigation changes are needed
as part of a user's interaction (clicking a link to see request details for example).
