The demo needs to follow a very specific setup/operation sequence to be
successful.

One Time Setups:
- Globally install lerna and truffle (npm i -g lerna; npm i -g truffle)
- Install all dashboard and mockMiner dependencies: (in tellorscan): lerna bootstrap
- Install all tellor core deps: (in Tellor-Core) npm i
- Install private keys into MetaMask
   DETAILS: Make sure to choose demo accounts that are NOT also miners.
   Looking at the set of accounts that get spit out when starting ganache,
   miner accounts are 0-5. So demo accounts should be like 8 and 9.
   We need at least two accounts for the demo: 1 to dispute/request data, and
   another to vote on disputes. Why? Because a disputer cannot vote for their
   own dispute. And if we used the miner addresses, it is VERY easy to accidently
   dispute a miner's value that is also one of the demo accounts which would
   ultimately lock the demo user from doing anything!

Demo Setup
- Start dashboard: (in tellorscan/packages/dashboard) npm start
- Start ganache-cli: ganache-cli -m "nick lucian brenda kevin sam fiscal patch fly damp ocean produce wish" -l 10000000
- Deploy contracts: (in Tellor-Core project) truffle migrate
- Setup init contract and request: (in Tellor-Core) truffle exec scripts/MockScript.js
- Refresh MetaMask by selecting the network localhost:8545
- If you've run a demo before and are starting from scratch, go to Settings and
  clear any cached data.
- Get a balance of tokens for the accounts using Get Token dropdown in the top nav Wallet section
   DETAILS: this is currently the lazyCoon function but somehow these accounts
   must have a balance before they can do anything including add tips, dispute
   and vote. And before disputing, make sure the voter has a balance or they
   won't be able to vote!
- Confirm balance using the Refresh Balance dropdown in the top nav Wallet section.

Demo Sequence
- UI should show a pending request for BTC/USD. Story is that it's waiting for miners
  to provide the 5-value slots
- Start the mock miner: (in tellorscan/packages/mockMiner) npm start
- UI should show the mined values filled in after about 5 seconds or so
- Click the add tip icon and enter a tip amount to submit to miners
- Should see a new current request and within a few seconds, miners should
  complete mining all 5 slots.
- Expand a Recent Mined Event and click the thumbs-down icon next to a value to dispute
- Should show the dispute screen with that item pre-selected/visible. Click the dispute button
- Confirm that the dispute shows up in the Open Disputes table
- Expanding the dispute you should see that the current demo account selected in
  MetaMask is not allowed to vote because they are the disputer.
- Switch accounts in MetaMask
- The voting should not be enabled. Vote up/down
- It should increase the vote count and show that the user can no longer vote
