There are two environments where mock miner will operate: demo and AWS

Demo

In demo mode, use the 'npm run mockMiner'. This will first build the mock miner
then run it. There are three environment variables you must define in a
.env file in the mockMiner project. The file should contain these contents:

WEB3_URL="ws://localhost:8545";
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x2B63d6e98E66C7e9fe11225Ba349B0B33234D9A2";

Change the contract address if it changes for whatever reason.

AWS

In AWS, the EC2 instance as pm2 managing a node app. See the setupEC2.sh script
to setup a fresh node. Otherwise, all the environment variables are held in
the ecosystem.config.js file,w hich pm2 uses to run the node app and configure
the execution environment.

If you need to change the environment variables, change them in the ecosystem.config.js
file and then run "pm2 restart ecosystem.config.js --update-env". This will stop/start
the mock miner and reload all environment variables in that config file.
