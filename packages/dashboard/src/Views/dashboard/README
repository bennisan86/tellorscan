Dashboard is broken into 4 main pieces: activities, modals, overview, and search.

Activities represent the current mining activities and request history.

Modals are any dialogue used in the dashboard to gather user info.

Overview is the top section of the dashboard and holds various analytic information
as well as current requests being mined, etc.

Search is a reusable search box that allows user to view request details by its id.
