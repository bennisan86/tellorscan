By far the most complex part of the Tellor dashboard is the Request data structure.
It represents all known requests and their associated interactions/events.

Requests have challenges, tips, and disputes along with metadata extracted from
a DataRequested log event coming from the smart contract. Think of this as a
tree structure:

                               Request
                           /      |     \
                          /       |      \
                    Challenges   Tips   Disputes
                    /   |   \
                   /    |    \
              Nonces  Value   Miners
                   
Challenges are a collection of NewChallenge events that also have a nested
set of Nonces, a final value, and an ordered set of miner addresses based on
their sorted winning order.

Nonces have information about a miner's submission and once a challenge is
finalized with a value, nonces are assigned a winning order. Nonces are ultimately
what can be disputed.

Once a challenge is finished, it is assigned a final value--which is basically
the NewValue log event from the smart contract. At that time, all its nonces are
also sorted in the order of winning miner addresses.

Disputes are assigned to a request, and in the dashboard get paired with a
challenge and a specific Nonce submission. The disputes fall under a request to
keep everything organized in a tree structure.
