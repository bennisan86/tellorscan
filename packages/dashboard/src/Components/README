Wherever possible, reusable React Components are in the Components module.
Not all reusable things are in this package, however, and more reuse is
probably possible with the current codebase. CleanTable, CollapseTable, and
ChallengeViewer are all a bit inter-tangled but serve specific purposes for
different views.

Note that Components, in general, do not have a connector "index.js". This is
because most components depend on other views to provide properties that are
rendered by the components in a generic way. Having an "index.js" implies that
specific state is fed to a component and is only the case where the state is
self-contained to support the component's functionality (such as various button
types or search).
